## Definition
Big-O is mathematical notation for asymptotic execution times.\
In **Computing Science**, Big-O notation is used to categorize algorithms based on how their **runtime** or **space** needs increase as the input size grows. Therefore, the execution time may vary greatly depending on the **efficiency of the algorithm**.
